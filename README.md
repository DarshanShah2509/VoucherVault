- **Cart-wise Coupons**: Discounts on the entire cart if a minimum threshold is met.

## Coupon Expiration Feature
Each coupon has an expirationDate field, which is set to 2 months from the creation date.
A scheduled cron job runs every day at midnight to automatically deactivate expired coupons.

## Cron Job Configuration
- The cron job is defined in CouponExpirationScheduler.java and uses the following schedule:
  --0 0 0 * * ? â€” Runs every day at midnight.

## How to Customize the Expiration Cron Job
Modify the cron expression in CouponExpirationScheduler.java if you want to adjust the frequency.

## Assumptions
- Coupons are applied to the cart only if they are active and not expired.
- Cart-wise coupons are applied only if the cart total meets the specified threshold.
- Product-wise coupons are applied to specific products present in the cart.
- BxGy coupons are applied based on the quantities specified in the coupon details.

## Limitations
- No Coupon Stacking: Multiple coupons cannot be applied to the same cart.
- No Region-Based Coupons: The system does not support coupons limited to specific regions or user locations.
- No Time-Sensitive Coupons: Coupons valid only during specific times (e.g., flash sales) are not supported.
- No Complex Buy X Get Y Scenarios: Only straightforward "Buy X, Get Y" deals are supported.

## Edge Cases Handled
- Expired coupons are automatically deactivated and not considered during coupon application.
- Validation of input data to ensure correct formats and required fields.
- Handles cases where no applicable coupons are found for a given cart.

## Future Enhancements
- Coupon Stacking: Allow multiple coupons to be applied to a single cart.
- User-Specific Coupons: Support coupons limited to specific users or user groups.
- Category-Based Discounts: Apply discounts to all products within a specific category.
- Time-Based Coupons: Support coupons valid during specific hours (e.g., happy hour discounts).
- Geo-Location Based Coupons: Add support for location-based coupon restrictions.
